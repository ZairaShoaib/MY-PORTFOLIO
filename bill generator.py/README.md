# Mini Project: Electricity Bill Calculator

## Objective
The objective of this mini project is to take electricity units from the user and calculate the electricity bill according to given rules.

## Problem Statement
Calculate electricity bill based on the following:
- First 100 units → Free
- Next 100 units (101–200) → 5 per unit
- Above 200 units → 10 per unit

## Logic / Working
- If units are 100 or less, the bill is 0.
- If units are between 101 and 200, only the units above 100 are charged at 5 per unit.
- If units are above 200:
  - 101–200 units → 5 per unit
  - Units above 200 → 10 per unit

## Conclusion

In this mini project, we have used Python's if-elif-else statements to create a real-life electricity billing system. This project is very useful and helps in understanding basic programming concepts.
