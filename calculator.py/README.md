# Mini Project: Simple Calculator

## Objective

The objective of this mini project is to create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. Asks the user to choose an operation: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), or Division (/).
3. Performs the chosen operation and displays the result.
4. Handles invalid inputs or division by zero gracefully.

## Logic / Working

* Take first and second numbers from the user.
* Ask the user for the desired operation.
* Use if-elif-else statements to perform the selected operation.
* Print the result.
* Handle division by zero using a condition.

## Conclusion

In this mini project, we have used Python's basic syntax, variables, conditional statements, and input/output functions to create a simple calculator. This project helps understand basic programming concepts and user input handling.

## Tools / Concepts Used

* Python
* Variables
* Input/Output
* Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)
